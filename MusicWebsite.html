      Jessie J kicked off her career with her debut album, called <em>Who Are You</em>, featuring her hit single "Price Tag". However, after overcoming troubles with her record label, she made a comeback in 2018 with her album called <em>R.O.S.E.</em>, which is a more introspective album where she talks about more personal ideas.

      Paramore became a band in 2004, with Hayley Williams as lead singer. However, over the years, despite the different members leaving with multiple disputes with them, Williams still managed to keep the band together
      and released their newest album, called <em>After Laughter</em>.
